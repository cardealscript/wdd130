        <p>
            Hello! My name is Cardeal Felisberto, and I am from Maputo, Mozambique.
            I was born on February 28, 2002, and I am proud to be the first child of my
            parents. I completed my secondary education in 2021 and am currently pursuing a
            certificate in Software Development at Brigham Young University–Idaho
            (BYU-Idaho), USA, through the BYU Pathway program.

            My main focus is web and computer programming, and I have a strong passion
            for technology and innovation. I am excited to be enrolled in the WDD 130
            course, where I am learning how to build engaging and user-friendly websites.
            I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal coding projects,
            and staying up to date with the latest trends in web development.

            My goal is to use these skills to create meaningful digital experiences and
            build a strong portfolio for future opportunities. I look forward to
            collaborating with my classmates and growing as a developer throughout
            this journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mozambique is a country located in southeastern Africa, rich in culture, history,
            and national pride. The people of Mozambique value family, unity, and tradition.
            Samora Machel, the first President of the Republic of Mozambique, once said that
            "Children are the flower that never fades", meaning they are the seed of the nation’s
            future.
            Children represent hope, growth, and progress for Mozambique. I am also a fruit of this
            land, raised by its values and history. Mozambique is a cradle of life, strength, and
            resilience, even though it is a complex country with many challenges.
